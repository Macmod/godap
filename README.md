## Package Repositories

Some members of the community have published `godap` in [package repositories](https://repology.org/project/godap/versions). The following packages are known to provide working releases of `godap`:

* *Homebrew*. [godap](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/godap) by `harpchad`
* *Alpine Linux (community)*. [godap](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/community/x86_64/godap) by `omni+alpine@hack.org`
* *Arch Linux (AUR)*. [godap-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/godap-bin) by `killab33z`

Remember to check `godap`'s version before using these packages, as some of them might not always be up to date.
In case you need the latest features, godap also provides [automated releases](https://github.com/Macmod/godap/releases) for several platforms.

# Usage

**Bind with username and password**

```bash
$ godap <hostname or IP> -u <username> -p <password> -d <domain>
```

or

```bash
$ godap <hostname or IP> -u <username>@<domain> -p <password>
```

**Bind with an NTLM hash**

```bash
$ godap <hostname or IP> -u <username> -H <hash> [-d <domain>]
```

**Bind with a Kerberos ticket**

```bash
$ KRB5CCNAME=ticket.ccache godap <hostname or IP> -k -d <domain> -t ldap/<DC hostname>
```

**Bind with a Certificate + Private Key**

PEM:
```bash
$ godap <hostname or IP> --crt <cert.pem> --key <cert.key> -I
```

PKCS#12:
```bash
$ godap <hostname or IP> --pfx <cert.pfx> -I
```

Note. This method will either pass the certificate directly when connecting with LDAPS (`-S`), or upgrade the unencrypted LDAP connection implicitly with StartTLS, therefore you must provide `-I` if you want to use it and your server certificate is not trusted by your client.

**Anonymous Bind**

```bash
$ godap <hostname or IP>
```

**LDAPS/StartTLS**

To use LDAPS for the initial connection (ignoring certificate validation) run:

```bash
$ godap <hostname or IP> [bind flags] -S -I
```

To use StartTLS to upgrade an existing connection to use TLS, use the `Ctrl + u` keybinding inside godap.

Notice that, if the server certificate is not trusted by your client, you must either have started godap with `-I` to use the upgrade command properly or toggle the `IgnoreCert` checkbox using the `l` keybinding before upgrading.

If LDAPS is available, you can also change the port using `l`, toggle the LDAPS checkbox, set the desired value for `IgnoreCert`, and reconnect with `Ctrl + r`.

**SOCKS**

To connect to LDAP through a SOCKS proxy include the flag `-x schema://ip:port`, where `schema` is one of `socks4`, `socks4a` or `socks5`.

You can also change the address of your proxy using the `l` keybinding.

## Tree Colors

The nodes in the explorer tree are colored as follows:

| Scenario                                | Color          |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Object exists and is enabled            | Default        |
| Object exists and is disabled           | Yellow\*       |
| Object was deleted and not yet recycled | Gray\*         |
| Object was recycled already             | Red\*          |

\* Before v2.2.0, disabled nodes were colored red. This was the only custom color in the tree panel; other nodes were colored with default colors (the "include deleted objects" flag had not been implemented yet).

# Contributing

Godap started as a fun side project, but has become a really useful tool since then. Unfortunately these days I only have limited time and there's much to be done, so if you like the tool and believe you can help please reach out to me directly at [@marzanol](https://t.me/marzanol) :-)

Contributions are also welcome by [opening an issue](https://github.com/Macmod/godap/issues/new) or by [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/Macmod/godap/pulls).

# Acknowledgements

* DACL parsing code and SOCKS code were adapted from the tools below:

  * [ldapper](https://github.com/Synzack/ldapper)
  * [Darksteel](https://github.com/wjlab/Darksteel)

* [BadBlood](https://github.com/davidprowe/BadBlood) was also very useful for testing during the development of the tool.

* Thanks [@vysecurity](https://github.com/vysecurity), [@SamErde](https://github.com/samerde) & all the others that shared the tool :)

# Disclaimers

* The main focus of this tool is Active Directory. If your target is not an Active Directory LDAP server, it's advised to set the `--backend` flag (available in versions above v2.10.4) to specify the "flavor" of your server, hiding features that aren't useful to you, and adapting others to work with your backend.

* All features were tested and seem to be working properly on a Windows Server 2019, but this tool is highly experimental and I cannot test it extensively - I don't take responsibility for modifications that you execute and end up impacting your environment. If you observe any unexpected behaviors please [let me know](https://github.com/Macmod/godap/issues/new) so I can try to fix it.
