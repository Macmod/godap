# Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Macmod/godap
$ cd godap
$ go install .
```

# Usage

**Bind with username and password**

```bash
$ godap <hostname or IP> -u <username>@<domain> -p <password>
```

**Bind with an NTLM hash**

```bash
$ godap <hostname or IP> -u <username> -H <hash> [-d <domain>]
```

**Anonymous Bind**

```bash
$ godap <hostname or IP> -p anything
```

**LDAPS/StartTLS**

To use LDAPS for the initial connection (ignoring certificate validation) run:

```bash
$ godap <hostname or IP> [bind flags] -S -I -P 636
```

To use StartTLS to upgrade an existing connection to use TLS, use the `u` keybinding inside godap.

Notice that, if the server certificate is not trusted by your client, you must either have started godap with `-I` to use the upgrade command properly or toggle the `IgnoreCert` checkbox using the `l` keybinding before upgrading.

If LDAPS is available, you can also change the port using `l`, toggle the LDAPS checkbox, set the desired value for `IgnoreCert`, and reconnect with `r`.

**SOCKS**

To connect to LDAP through a SOCKS proxy include the flag `-x schema://ip:port`, where `schema` is one of `socks4`, `socks4a` or `socks5`.

You can also change the address of your proxy using the `l` keybinding.

## Flags

* `-u`,`--username` - Username for bind
* `-p`,`--password` - Password for bind
* `--passfile` - Path to a file containing the password for bind
* `-P`,`--port` - Custom port for the connection (default: `389`)
* `-r`,`--rootDN <distinguishedName>` - Initial root DN (default: automatic)
* `-f`,`--filter <search filter>` - Initial LDAP search filter (default: `(objectClass=*)`)
* `-E`,`--emojis` - Prefix objects with emojis (default: `true`, to change use `-emojis=false`)
* `-C`,`--colors` - Colorize objects (default: `true`, to change use `-colors=false`)
* `-A`,`--expand` - Expand multi-value attributes (default: `true`, to change use `-expand=false`)
* `-L`,`--limit` - Number of attribute values to render for multi-value attributes when `-expand` is `true` (default: `20`)
* `-F`,`--format` - Format attributes into human-readable values (default: `true`, to change use `-format=false`)
* `-M`,`--cache` - Keep loaded entries in memory while the program is open and don't query them again (default: `true`)
* `-I`,`--insecure` - Skip TLS verification for LDAPS/StartTLS (default: `false`)
* `-S`,`--ldaps` - Use LDAPS for initial connection (default: `false`)
* `-G`,`--paging` - Paging size for regular queries (default: `800`)
* `-d`,`--domain` - Domain for NTLM bind
* `-H`,`--hashes` - Hashes for NTLM bind
* `--hashfile` - Path to a file containing the hashes for NTLM bind
* `-x`,`--socks` - URI of SOCKS proxy to use for connection (supports `socks4://`, `socks4a://` or `socks5://` schemas)
* `-k`,`--schema` - Load GUIDs from schema on initialization (default: `false`)

# Acknowledgements

* DACL parsing code and SOCKS code were adapted from the tools below:

  * [ldapper](https://github.com/Synzack/ldapper)
  * [Darksteel](https://github.com/wjlab/Darksteel)

* [BadBlood](https://github.com/davidprowe/BadBlood) was also very useful for testing during the development of the tool.

# Disclaimers

* Although some features might work with OpenLDAP (mainly in the explorer/search pages), the main focus of this tool is Active Directory.
* All features were tested and seem to be working properly on a Windows Server 2019, but this tool is highly experimental and I cannot test it extensively - I don't take responsibility for modifications that you execute and end up impacting your environment. If you observe any unexpected behaviors please [let me know](https://github.com/Macmod/godap/issues/new) so I can try to fix it.
* I'm not prioritizing Kerberos authentication at the moment. Although `ldapper` (which was a great source of inspiration and useful code) supports it, the `ldapper` authors chose to rewrite lots of dependencies maintained by third parties in order to provide this feature. This does not seem like the best approach in terms of long-term support. Nonetheless, `go-ldap` (which is godap's main dependency) currently has [an open issue](https://github.com/go-ldap/ldap/issues/115) from 2017 regarding the lack of GSSAPI support. A pull request [has been merged](https://github.com/go-ldap/ldap/pull/402) in 2022 to deal with the issue on Windows platforms only, but that isn't a suitable option for this tool. I hope someone finds a solution for this issue (maybe [go-ldap/ldap/pull/449](https://github.com/go-ldap/ldap/pull/449)) that doesn't involve rewriting dependencies I won't have time to maintain :-)
