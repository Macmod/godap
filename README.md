# Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Macmod/godap
$ cd godap
$ go install .
```

# Usage

**Bind with username and password**

```bash
$ godap <hostname or IP> -u <username>@<domain> -p <password>
```

**Bind with an NTLM hash**

```bash
$ godap <hostname or IP> -u <username> -H <hash> [-d <domain>]
```

**Bind with a Kerberos ticket**

```bash
$ KRB5CCNAME=ticket.ccache godap <hostname or IP> -k -d <domain> -t ldap/<DC hostname>
```

**Anonymous Bind**

```bash
$ godap <hostname or IP> -p anything
```

**LDAPS/StartTLS**

To use LDAPS for the initial connection (ignoring certificate validation) run:

```bash
$ godap <hostname or IP> [bind flags] -S -I -P 636
```

To use StartTLS to upgrade an existing connection to use TLS, use the `Ctrl + u` keybinding inside godap.

Notice that, if the server certificate is not trusted by your client, you must either have started godap with `-I` to use the upgrade command properly or toggle the `IgnoreCert` checkbox using the `l` keybinding before upgrading.

If LDAPS is available, you can also change the port using `l`, toggle the LDAPS checkbox, set the desired value for `IgnoreCert`, and reconnect with `Ctrl + r`.

**SOCKS**

To connect to LDAP through a SOCKS proxy include the flag `-x schema://ip:port`, where `schema` is one of `socks4`, `socks4a` or `socks5`.

You can also change the address of your proxy using the `l` keybinding.

## Flags

* `-u`,`--username` - Username for bind
* `-p`,`--password` - Password for bind
* `--passfile` - Path to a file containing the password for bind
* `-P`,`--port` - Custom port for the connection (default: `389`)
* `-r`,`--rootDN <distinguishedName>` - Initial root DN (default: automatic)
* `-f`,`--filter <search filter>` - Initial LDAP search filter (default: `(objectClass=*)`)
* `-E`,`--emojis` - Prefix objects with emojis (default: `true`, to change use `-emojis=false`)
* `-C`,`--colors` - Colorize objects (default: `true`, to change use `-colors=false`)
* `-A`,`--expand` - Expand multi-value attributes (default: `true`, to change use `-expand=false`)
* `-L`,`--limit` - Number of attribute values to render for multi-value attributes when `-expand` is `true` (default: `20`)
* `-F`,`--format` - Format attributes into human-readable values (default: `true`, to change use `-format=false`)
* `-M`,`--cache` - Keep loaded entries in memory while the program is open and don't query them again (default: `true`)
* `-D`,`--deleted` - Include deleted objects in all queries performed (default: `false`)
* `-T`,`--timeout` - Timeout for LDAP connections in seconds (default: `10`)

* `-d`,`--domain` - Domain name for NTLM / Kerberos authentication
* `-H`,`--hashes` - Hashes for NTLM bind
* `-k`,`--kerberos` - Use Kerberos ticket for authentication (CCACHE specified via `KRB5CCNAME` environment variable)
* `-t`,`--spn` - Target SPN to use for Kerberos bind (usually `ldap/dchostname`)
* `--hashfile` - Path to a file containing the hashes for NTLM bind
* `-x`,`--socks` - URI of SOCKS proxy to use for connection (supports `socks4://`, `socks4a://` or `socks5://` schemas)
* `-s`,`--schema` - Load GUIDs from schema on initialization (default: `false`)
* `--kdc` - Address of the KDC to use with Kerberos authentication (optional: only if the KDC differs from the specified LDAP server)
* `--timefmt` - Time format for LDAP timestamps. Options: eu, us, [iso8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), or define your own using [go time format](https://go.dev/src/time/format.go) (default: `eu`)

## Tree Colors

The nodes in the explorer tree are colored as follows:

| Scenario                                | Color          |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Object exists and is enabled            | Default        |
| Object exists and is disabled           | Yellow\*       |
| Object was deleted and not yet recycled | Gray\*         |
| Object was recycled already             | Red\*          |

\* Before v2.2.0, disabled nodes were colored red. This was the only custom color in the tree panel; other nodes were colored with default colors (the "include deleted objects" flag had not been implemented yet).

# Acknowledgements

* DACL parsing code and SOCKS code were adapted from the tools below:

  * [ldapper](https://github.com/Synzack/ldapper)
  * [Darksteel](https://github.com/wjlab/Darksteel)

* [BadBlood](https://github.com/davidprowe/BadBlood) was also very useful for testing during the development of the tool.

# Disclaimers

* Although some features might work with OpenLDAP (mainly in the explorer/search pages), the main focus of this tool is Active Directory.
* All features were tested and seem to be working properly on a Windows Server 2019, but this tool is highly experimental and I cannot test it extensively - I don't take responsibility for modifications that you execute and end up impacting your environment. If you observe any unexpected behaviors please [let me know](https://github.com/Macmod/godap/issues/new) so I can try to fix it.
